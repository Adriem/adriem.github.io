            I love developing software and working with web technologies, as
            well as learning new programming languages.
            Some of my hobbies are writing cool code, reading good books,
            pressing buttons on a gamepad and pulling the strings of a guitar.

        I am always trying to learn new things, experimenting on them and
        developing prototypes.
        Here you can take a look at some of the little projects I do in my
        spare time. Hope you find them interesting!

        I think it's really interesting sharing code with other people. Also,
        I find really helpful to keep important code under version
        control. Take a look at some of my repositories!
