              Hi there! My name is Adri√°n Moreno and I am a Software Engineering
              from Zaragoza, a city from North-East Spain.

              In my spare time I like to develop little projects and mess with
              DIY stuff. I am very intrested in software development and
              software architecture, as well as web technologies, programming
              languages and game development.

      <h2 class="section-header text-center"> Some facts </h2>
      <p class="col-md-4 col-xs-12 col-sm-6 fact">
        <strong>I prefer working during the night.</strong> I can perfectly stay
        awake all night long coding and then sleep in the morning, but I have to
        force myself to follow regular human hours.
      <p>
      <p class="col-md-4 col-xs-12 col-sm-6 fact">
        <strong>I don't usually work in complete silence.</strong> I like to work
        while listening to music, but sometimes I just want some noise around me.
        It helps me to get focused on what I'm doing.
      <p>
      <p class="col-md-4 col-xs-12 col-sm-6 fact">
        <strong>I was interested in game development even before I knew how to
        code.</strong> I used to invent tabletop and card games with my friends
        in high school. I have started developing many games, but I haven't
        finished any of them.
      <p>
      <p class="col-md-4 col-xs-12 col-sm-6 fact">
        <strong>I love walking in nature</strong>, especially in quiet places
        where I can be all alone. When I'm exhausted I like to go to a little
        forest in a park near college.
      <p>
      <p class="col-md-4 col-xs-12 col-sm-6 fact">
        <strong>I'd rather live in a small town in the mountains</strong>
        near nature than in a big city (if I could choose), but it should be a
        town with a decent internet connection! :P
      <p>
      <p class="col-md-4 col-xs-12 col-sm-6 fact">
        <strong>I also play the guitar</strong>, but I'm always so busy that I
        can't practice as much as I should. I have been in some music groups with
        my friends. I play mainly rock and metal music \m/.

            I have always a lot of projects in my head, from software projects
            to DIY stuff, so I have to use tools to keep them organized and be
            able to accomplish them (well, at least some of them).

            <!--The longest time I have stayed awake is 23 hours. We had a deadline-->
            <!--approaching and an application that had to be almost entirely-->
            <!--rewritten.-->

      <h2 class="section-header text-center"> Why this site? </h2>
      <p class="fact">
          When I started developing web applications, I thought it could be great
          being able to host them, so people could play around with them. I
          started using GitHub pages, but since they don't give you access to a
          backend, I decided to buy a Raspberry PI 2 and host my backends there.
          After a bunch of hours in front of the command line interpreter, I
          managed to set up a web server in this little beast. Then I thought I
          needed a home page where I could track all my projects, so I built this
          page :D.
