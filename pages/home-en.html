      I love developing software and working with web technologies, as
      well as learning new programming languages.
      Apart from writing code, some of my hobbies include reading good stories,
      pressing buttons on a gamepad and pulling the strings of a guitar.

      I think it's really positive and constructive sharing code with other people.
