    body: >
      My passion is developing software, specially front-end applications.
      Design patterns, clean software architecture and best practices
      along with a special care on the user experience and the design
      allow me to build robust and rich applications.


  # Apart from writing code, I also enjoy music, books, videogames and having
  # some crafted beer with my friends at a quiet pub.

  # My passion is developing software. I love working with web technologies
  # and learning different programming languages. I always try to push myself
  # for learning new stuff and staying out of my comfort zone.
  # Apart from writing code, I also enjoy playing the guitar, reading books,
