        Writing code from Zaragoza, Spain

      <p class="content-regular-text">
        Hi there! My name is Adrian Moreno, and I am a professional front-end
        developer. I am currently working for Building Blocks Spain while I
        finish my engineering studies.


        <!--
        My passion is developing software, specially front-end applications.
        Design patterns, clean software architecture and best practices,
        along with a special care on the user experience and the design,
        allow me to build robust and rich applications.

      <p class="content-regular-text">
        Apart from writing code, I also enjoy music, books, videogames and
        having a crafted beer with my friends at a quiet pub.

        <span class="fact-lead">Code.</span>
        I write code for a living and I love it. As a front-end developer,
        my main languages are <strong>Javascript</strong>,
        <strong>Typescript</strong>, <strong>Coffeescript</strong>, and the
        framework I am more experienced with is <strong>AngularJS</strong>.
        I'm familiar with different programming paradigms such as
        Object Oriented Programming, Functional
        Programming and Reactive Programming.
        Design patterns, clean software architecture, testing techniques
        and best practices allow me to build robust and rich applications.

      My name is Adri√°n Moreno and I am a frontend developer from
      Zaragoza, a city from North-East Spain. I hope I'm finishing my
      Software Engineering studies this year, while I work in what I
      love to do: software development. I am mainly focused in
      <strong>web technologies and software architecture</strong>, but
      I find interesting everything related to softare development.
    </p>
    <p class="regular-text align-center" style="width: 70%; text-align: justify; margin: 1rem auto;">
      My favourite programming languages are <strong>Coffeescript and
      Javascript</strong>, but I'm always open to learn new languages.
      I really enjoy developing frontend applications and my favourite framework
      is <strong>AngularJS</strong>. When I have to work on the backend side I
      use either <strong>node.js</strong> or <strong>java with SpringBoot</strong>.
