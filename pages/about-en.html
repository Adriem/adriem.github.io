        I love developing software, but I have other passions too!
        When I'm not coding, I play my guitar, play videogames or read.
        I also love riding my bike and walking in nature if the weather
        is good. I don't like to stay in my comfort zone
        for too long. I like things simple: less is more.

      <p class="regular-text">
          My name is Adrián Moreno and I am a frontend developer from
          Zaragoza, a city from North-East Spain. I hope I'm finishing my
          Software Engineering studies this year, while I work in what I
          love to do: software development. I am mainly focused in
          <strong>web technologies and software architecture</strong>, but
          I find interesting everything related to softare development.

      <p class="regular-text">
          My favourite programming languages are <strong>Coffeescript and
          Javascript</strong>, but I'm always open to learn new languages.
          I really enjoy developing frontend applications and my favourite framework
          is <strong>AngularJS</strong>. When I have to work on the backend side I
          use either <strong>node.js</strong> or <strong>java with SpringBoot</strong>.

  facts:
    title: Some facts about me!
    list:
    - >
      **I don't usually work in complete silence.** I like to work
      while listening to music, but sometimes I just need some noise around me.
      It helps me to get focused on what I'm doing.
    - >
      **I am a vim lover.** I am far from being a vim power user
      or anything like that, but I feel quite comfortable using it, specially
      along with tmux. As a side effect, I try to 'hjkl' everywhere :)
    - >
      **I've been always interested in game development.** Before I knew how
      to code, I used to invent tabletop games with my friends at high school.
      Now I work mainly with Unity.
    - >
      **I deploy my projects on a Raspberry PI**. I know there are many
      alternatives to host web applications out there, but doing it on my
      own is really interesting and makes me learn a lot.
    - >
      **I love walking in nature**, especially in quiet places where I can be
      alone. When I'm exhausted I like to go to a little park near college and
      get some fresh air.
    - >
      **I also play the guitar**, but I'm always so busy that I
      can't practice as much as I should. I have been in some music groups with
      my friends, playing mainly rock and metal \m/.
