            I love developing software, but I have other passions too!
            When I'm not coding, I play my guitar, play videogames or read.
            I also love riding my bike and walking in nature if the weather
            is good. I don't like to stay in my comfort zone
            for too long. I like things simple: less is more.

    <p class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 normal-text">
        My name is Adri√°n Moreno and I am a frontend developer from
        Zaragoza, a city from North-East Spain. I hope I'm finishing my
        Software Engineering studies this year, while I work in what I
        love to do: software development. I am mainly focused in
        <strong>web technologies and software architecture</strong>, but
        I find interesting everything related to softare development.

    <p class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 normal-text">
        My favourite programming languages are <strong>Coffeescript and
        Javascript</strong>, but I'm always open to learn new languages.
        I really enjoy developing frontend applications and my favourite framework
        is <strong>AngularJS</strong>. When I have to work on the backend side I
        use either <strong>node.js</strong> or <strong>java with SpringBoot</strong>.
