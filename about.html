            I love developing software, but I have other passions too!
            When I'm not coding, I play my guitar, play videogames or read.
            I also love riding my bike and walking in nature if the weather
            is good. Always with lots of projects in my head, from software
            projects to DIY stuff. I don't like to stay in my comfort zone
            for too long. I like things simple: less is more.

    <h2 class="section-header text-center"> Who am I? </h2>

    <p class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 normal-text">
        My name is Adri√°n Moreno and I am a Software Engineering student from
        Zaragoza, a city from North-East Spain. I hope I'm finishing my studies
        this year, so I can start working on one of my passions: software
        development. I am mainly interested in <strong>web technologies and
        software architecture</strong>, but I am also interested in game
        development and IT administration.
    </p>

    <p class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 normal-text">
        My favourite programming languages are <strong>Coffeescript and
        Javascript</strong>, but I'm always trying to learn new languages and
        experimenting on them. I really enjoy developing <strong>HTML5</strong>
        apps and I'm in love with <strong>node.js and AngularJS</strong> (on
        its version 1.x), since they allow me to use my favourite languages for
        building rich applications, either in the frontend and the backend.
    </p>

    <p class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 normal-text">
        <strong>I have worked many years with Java</strong> and, although it's
        not my preferred language, I have built lots of applications with it.
        I have also worked with several languages like C, Python, Erlang,
        Haskell and even ARM Assembly. I'm a big fan of responsive design and
        mobile-first philosophies, and I find agile metodologies really
        interesting and useful.
