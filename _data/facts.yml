    **I don't usually work in complete silence.** I like to work
    while listening to music, but sometimes I just need some noise around me.
    It helps me to get focused on what I'm doing.

    **I am a vim lover.** I am far from being a vim power user
    or anything like that, but I feel quite comfortable using it, specially
    along with tmux. As a side effect, I try to 'hjkl' everywhere :)

    **I've been always interested in game development.** Before I knew how
    to code, I used to invent tabletop games with my friends at high school.
    Now I work mainly with Unity.

    **I deploy my projects on a Raspberry PI**. I know there are many
    alternatives to host web applications out there, but doing it on my
    own is really interesting and makes me learn a lot.

    **I love walking in nature**, especially in quiet places where I can be
    alone. When I'm exhausted I like to go to a little park near college and
    get some fresh air.

    **I also play the guitar**, but I'm always so busy that I
    can't practice as much as I should. I have been in some music groups with
    my friends, playing mainly rock and metal \m/.
