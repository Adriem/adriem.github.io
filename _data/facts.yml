    **I am a nocturnal animal.** I can perfectly stay awake
    all night long working and then sleep in the morning, but I have to
    force myself to follow regular human hours.

    **I don't usually work in complete silence.** I like to work
    while listening to music, but sometimes I just want some noise around me.
    It helps me to get focused on what I'm doing.

    # **I love to work wity my Raspberry PI.** Since my laptop
    # died some time ago but I still need to code when I'm not at home, I do
    # a lot of programming directly on my Raspberry PI from an android tablet
    # over SSH. It can be tough sometimes, but I find it pretty interesting
    # (and even funny).-->

    **I was interested in game development even before I knew how to
    code.** I used to invent tabletop and card games with my friends
    in high school. I tend to start a lot of projects, but I finish few of
    them.

    # **I have always too many projects in my head**, from
    # software projects to DIY stuff, so I have to use tools to keep them
    # organized and be able to accomplish them (or, at least, some of them).

    **I am a vim fan.** I am far from being a vim power user
    or anything like that, but I feel quite comfortable with it and I find
    its way of working really interesting.<!-- Now I have become an adicted-->
    <!--to 'hjkl' and I try to use it everywhere :).-->

    **I love walking in nature**, especially in quiet places
    where I can be all alone. When I'm exhausted I like to go to a little
    forest in a park near college.

    # **I'd rather live in a small town in the mountains**
    # near nature than in a big city (if I could choose), but it should be a
    # town with a decent internet connection! :P

    **I also play the guitar**, but I'm always so busy that I
    can't practice as much as I should. I have been in some music groups with
    my friends. I play mainly rock and metal music \m/.

    # **The longest time I have stayed awake is 23 hours.** We had a deadline
    # approaching and an application that had to be almost entirely
    # rewritten.
