    Hi there! My name is Adrian Moreno, and I am a professional
    front-end developer. I am currently working for Building Blocks
    Spain while I finish my engineering studies. Design patterns, clean
    software architecture and best practices allow me to build robust
    and rich applications.

    Apart from writing code, I also enjoy music, books, videogames and
    having a crafted beer with my friends at a quiet pub.
